# token-staking

A smart contract allowing you to stake ether as well as a custom-created ERC20 token.

My first ever steps into the blockchain world, created when I started as in intern at [ZGEN](https://github.com/zgendao). It served as a starting point for [zgendao/utopia-fund](https://github.com/zgendao/utopia-fund).

If you're interested in my subsequent works, find me on [Telegram](https://t.me/Tomi_Ohl).
